# student-alchohol-consumption
This is my first project in Data Scientist career path. I take this project after finishing several of courses in Datacamp, all related to python programing, pandas and little bit about visualization.The aim of this project is reviewing all knowledge I've leanred.

# About the dataset
This dataset is published on Kaggle, you can visit it via link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption.
As the description of the dataset. This dataset contains some interesting information related to students attending into a Math course and Portuguese language course, and in my project, I just exploratory the data is took from the Math course. 
The dataset provide information such as family, education ... that help us in exploratory more about the student life.

# Goal:
    - Try to find out the relationship between grade score and other information that provided in the dataset.
    - Leverage the knowledge I've learned from Datacamp course.
    - Predicting final grade score in the future after completing some modules related to Machine Learning

# Tasks (will be updated even when I find a new interesting question)

I will divided the aspects effect on the grade of the student into 3 categories:

    - Family: All information related to family aspect included mother-father job, education, family educational support, etc.
    - Life: All information related to the personal life of student such as alchohol consumption times in a week, relationship with friends, extra-curricular activities, hanging out with friends, current health status, age ...
    - Educational: All information related to the student educational such as study time, taking a higher education, absences times...

Base on these catagories, I will try to find out and giving my assuming how these aspect effect on the grade of each student. And by somehow, we can understand a little bit about the grade of each student, what good and not good aspect may effect on them.

## Thank you for taking time watching
